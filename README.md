For this mini_ex the assignment was to make something that captured data, using some of the functions from P5 DOM. 
I found this assignment a bit more challenging than the former exercises, so I went for more simple functions in my code. I had some complications with coming up with an idea to capture data, but mostly coming up with an idea that I could manage to code. The code is actually quite simple. I made two buttons using the P5 dom library, and then some text, where the programme asks the user "How are you feeling?". There are only 2 options, "SAD" or "HURT", and then when either of the options are pressed, the screnn changes the text to "Here is something to cheer you up!" and the son "We're going to Ibiza" by Vengaboys starts playing. 
My thought behind the work, is a more critical approach to data capturing. Often there are predetermined options made for us, like facebbok where you can like, love, dislike etc., but the choices are already made in advance by Facebook. The same if you take a personality test fx and you have to click the answer that is best suited for you, even though the option might not fit you perfectly. So when facebook and other companies are collectiong data from us and then try to make suggestions to things that we like or they are using your data to figure out what kind of person you are, the data that they collect might not be correct according to what we actually like or how we actually are. 
My plan with my program was to hightlight this problem, by only offering two options for people to describe how they are feeling, and the two options beeing very similar and not leaving that much freedom for the user to express themselves. Furthermore, the song that plays is a upbeat song about summer and vacation, which most people combine with happiness, however the song might annoy some people or they just don't associate the song with something cheerful. I got the idea with the music from Spotify. Spotify also captures your data and make suggestions for you, based on what you've previously have been listening to or what type of songs that's on your different playlists. However, I often experience that these suggestions don't fit my taste or my playlists. I believe that the reason for this is, that different people like different elements of a song, so you can't just make predetermine what kind of songs you like. 
In short, my goal was to highlight this problem of data capturing, where the options are made in advance and where the options might not fit the user, and the result therefore might not suit or help the user.

I hope to get more familiar with the P5 dom library and all its options for next time, so I can create something a bit more advanced.
